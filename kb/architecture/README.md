**Usage in Agent:** All documents in this directory are injected into the agent's
system prompt at session start via `agent/context_builder.py`. The agent does not
need to request them — they are part of its baseline knowledge.

**Verification:** Every document has passed an injection test (see `injection_tests/`
directory). Protocol: (1) fresh LLM session, (2) document loaded as only context,
(3) specific question asked, (4) answer matches expected.

**Maintenance:** Updates by Intelligence Officers only. Mob session review required
before modification. All changes recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
