# Injection test — tool_scoping.md

## Document under test
`kb/architecture/tool_scoping.md`

## Why this test is critical
tool_scoping.md is the second mandatory document loaded at every session start. If the agent cannot derive correct tool routing from this document alone, every database query call will go to the wrong tool or use the wrong dialect.

## Test questions

### Question 1
"A query requires customer revenue from PostgreSQL and their support ticket count from MongoDB. Which tools do I call, in what order, and how do I combine the results?"

Required concepts:
- Call query_db for PostgreSQL revenue data
- Use standard SQL syntax for PostgreSQL
- Call query_db separately for MongoDB ticket count
- Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax for MongoDB not SQL
- Call execute_python to merge the two result sets in Python
- Never attempt a cross-database join at the SQL level
- Sub-queries go to each database separately before merging

Forbidden contradictions:
- Stating to use SQL syntax for MongoDB
- Stating to join across databases at the query level
- Stating to use a different tool than query_db for database queries

---

### Question 2
"I need to query a DuckDB dataset. What query dialect do I use and what functions are available that differ from standard PostgreSQL SQL?"

Required concepts:
- Use analytical SQL with DuckDB extensions
- DuckDB supports UNNEST
- DuckDB supports LIST_AGG
- DuckDB supports STRUCT
- DuckDB supports columnar functions
- Do not use PostgreSQL-specific syntax in DuckDB
- Database file path is defined in the dataset db_config.yaml

Forbidden contradictions:
- Stating DuckDB uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax
- Stating DuckDB uses identical syntax to PostgreSQL with no differences

---

### Question 3
"What is the purpose of the return_answer tool, when exactly should I use it, and what should I never do with it?"

Required concepts:
- return_answer terminates the agent loop
- return_answer records the final answer
- It is the last tool called in any successful agent run
- Use it only when the answer is verified and complete
- Do not call return_answer with an unverified or suspicious result

Forbidden contradictions:
- Stating return_answer executes database queries
- Stating return_answer can be called at any point during execution
- Stating return_answer is optional

---

### Question 4
"A query returns zero rows. According to the tool scoping document, what is the exact sequence of steps I must follow?"

Required concepts:
- Do not return the zero-row result to the user
- Do not call return_answer with the zero-row result
- Investigate the cause of the failure
- Check whether join keys have different formats across databases
- Check whether the correct database tool was called for the database type
- Adjust the approach and resolve the identified cause
- Use execute_python to merge results from separate database calls rather than attempting cross-database joins
- Only call return_answer after the retried result is verified and non-suspicious

Forbidden contradictions:
- Stating to return the zero-row result as the final answer
- Stating cross-database SQL joins are acceptable
- Stating return_answer should be called immediately after zero rows

## Test result

**Run timestamp:** 2026-04-11 12:04 UTC
**Model used:** anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
**Document tested:** kb/architecture/tool_scoping.md
**Overall result:** PASS
**Average score:** 100.0/100

### Question 1 — PASS (100/100)

**Question:** A query requires customer revenue from PostgreSQL and their support ticket count from MongoDB. Which tools do I call, in what order, and how do I combine the results?

**Concepts found (7/7):**
  - [x] Call query_db for PostgreSQL revenue data
  - [x] Use standard SQL syntax for PostgreSQL
  - [x] Call query_db separately for MongoDB ticket count
  - [x] Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax for MongoDB not SQL
  - [x] Call execute_python to merge the two result sets in Python
  - [x] Never attempt a cross-database join at the SQL level
  - [x] Sub-queries go to each database separately before merging

**Actual answer:**
Based on the document, here's the sequence for handling a query that spans PostgreSQL and MongoDB:

## Tools to call and order:

1. **`query_db`** for PostgreSQL customer revenue data
   - Use standard SQL (PostgreSQL 17.9) syntax
   - Query the revenue data you need

2. **`query_db`** for MongoDB support ticket count  
   - Use MongoDB aggregation pipeline JSON syntax (NOT SQL)
   - Format as pipeline arrays: `[{"$match": {...}}, {"$group": {...}}]`

3. **`execute_python`** to merge the results
   - Fetch results from each database into Python variables
   - Perform the data merging/joining in Python code
   - Do NOT attempt cross-database joins at the SQL level

4. **`return_answer`** with the final merged result
   - Only call this after verifying the result is complete and non-suspicious

## Key points:
- Route sub-queries to each database separately using `query_db`
- Never attempt cross-database joins at the SQL level - always merge in Python
- Use the correct query dialect for each database type (SQL for PostgreSQL, aggregation pipeline for MongoDB)
- Each tool has a single responsibility - use `query_db` for database queries and `execute_python` for data transformation

**Grader reasoning:** All seven required concepts are clearly present and no forbidden contradictions were found in the actual answer.

### Question 2 — PASS (100/100)

**Question:** I need to query a DuckDB dataset. What query dialect do I use and what functions are available that differ from standard PostgreSQL SQL?

**Concepts found (7/7):**
  - [x] Use analytical SQL with DuckDB extensions
  - [x] DuckDB supports UNNEST
  - [x] DuckDB supports LIST_AGG
  - [x] DuckDB supports STRUCT
  - [x] DuckDB supports columnar functions
  - [x] Do not use PostgreSQL-specific syntax in DuckDB
  - [x] Database file path is defined in the dataset db_config.yaml

**Actual answer:**
Based on the document, for querying a DuckDB dataset:

**Query dialect:** Analytical SQL with DuckDB extensions

**Tool to use:** `query_db`

**Functions available that differ from standard PostgreSQL SQL:**
- `UNNEST`
- `LIST_AGG` 
- `STRUCT`
- Columnar functions (specific functions not detailed in the document)

**Additional notes:**
- DuckDB is efficient for aggregations over large datasets
- It's file-based with no server required
- Database file path is defined in db_config.yaml
- You should use DuckDB-native functions and NOT use PostgreSQL-specific syntax

**Grader reasoning:** All required concepts are clearly present in the actual answer with no forbidden contradictions found.

### Question 3 — PASS (100/100)

**Question:** What is the purpose of the return_answer tool, when exactly should I use it, and what should I never do with it?

**Concepts found (5/5):**
  - [x] return_answer terminates the agent loop
  - [x] return_answer records the final answer
  - [x] It is the last tool called in any successful agent run
  - [x] Use it only when the answer is verified and complete
  - [x] Do not call return_answer with an unverified or suspicious result

**Actual answer:**
Based on the document, here is the information about the `return_answer` tool:

## Purpose
The `return_answer` tool is used to "terminate the agent loop and record the final answer." It is described as "the last tool called in any successful agent run."

## When exactly to use it
- Only when "the answer is verified and complete"
- After you have verified that your result is correct and non-suspicious
- As the final step in a successful workflow

## What you should never do with it
- **Never call it with an unverified or suspicious result**
- **Never call it with a zero-row result** - the document explicitly states "Do not call `return_answer` with the zero-row result" because "A zero-row result is a failure signal, not an answer"
- Never use it until you have properly investigated and resolved any issues with your query results

The document emphasizes that if you get zero rows or suspicious results, you must first investigate the cause, adjust your approach, retry using appropriate methods (like `execute_python` for cross-database merging), and only call `return_answer` after the retried result is verified and complete.

**Grader reasoning:** All five required concepts are clearly present in the answer and no forbidden contradictions were found.

### Question 4 — PASS (100/100)

**Question:** A query returns zero rows. According to the tool scoping document, what is the exact sequence of steps I must follow?

**Concepts found (8/8):**
  - [x] Do not return the zero-row result to the user
  - [x] Do not call return_answer with the zero-row result
  - [x] Investigate the cause of the failure
  - [x] Check whether join keys have different formats across databases
  - [x] Check whether the correct database tool was called for the database type
  - [x] Adjust the approach and resolve the identified cause
  - [x] Use execute_python to merge results from separate database calls rather than attempting cross-database joins
  - [x] Only call return_answer after the retried result is verified and non-suspicious

**Actual answer:**
According to the document, when a query returns zero rows, you must follow this exact sequence:

1. **Do not return the zero-row result to the user and do not call `return_answer` with it.**

2. **Investigate the cause:** check whether join keys have different formats across databases (e.g. integer in PostgreSQL vs "CUST-00123" string in MongoDB). Check whether the correct database tool was called for the database type (e.g. SQL syntax sent to MongoDB).

3. **Adjust the approach** — resolve the join key format mismatch or switch to the correct tool.

4. **Retry using `execute_python` to merge results from separate database calls** rather than attempting cross-database joins at the SQL level.

5. **Only call `return_answer` after the retried result is verified and non-suspicious.**

The document emphasizes that "A zero-row result is a failure signal, not an answer" and explicitly states not to return zero-row results to the user or call `return_answer` with them.

**Grader reasoning:** All eight required concepts are clearly present in the actual answer with no forbidden contradictions detected.
